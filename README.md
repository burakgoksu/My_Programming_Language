# My_Programming_Language
Design Your Own Programming Languag

I design a new project language with python 3.9:

•	The project was coded on Visual Studio Code

•	The grammar of the language is in BNF format.

•	The project has three layers.
•	Lexer and Parser classes was coded in this project.
•	Constant, Errors, Position, Token, Nodes, Values, List, Context, Symbol Table, Interpreter structures was design in this programming language.
•	Assignment operations, basic string operations, basic math operations, basic list operations can be done.


Information of the Programming Language:

•	The programming language has a comment line and is created with the # sign.
•	We can use \t and \n for rows operation.
•	We should write it in an indent structure with function and loop.
•	We must use VAR and = keywords to assignment an object.
•	Addition  + , subtraction  - , multiplication  * , division  / ,  power  ^ , equal , greater  > ,  less  <  ,  greater /less and equal  >= , <=  operations can be done.
•	The function must be created with FUN and closed with END.
•	We can use RETURN at the end of the function.
•	The loop must be created with FOR , WHILE and it closed with END also TO, THEN is can be used in the loop.
•	The statements must be created with IF , ELIF (else-if) , ELSE also TO, THEN is can be used in the statement.
•	We can use == (if equal) , != (if not equal) , AND , OR in the statements.
•	We can use BREAK and CONTINUE keywords in the loop whenever we want.
•	We can create a list with [] like Python. 
•	The list class has APPEND(list_name,variable) function to add a variable in the list
•	The list class has POP (list_name,variable) function to remove a variable in the list.
•	The list class has EXTEND (list_name,variable) function to extend the list.
•	The list class has CLEAR (list_name,variable) function to clear the list.
•	The programming language has LEN (object) function for the learning the length.
•	We can use NULL , FALSE , TRUE structure whenever we need these.
•	We get Boolean results about the type of object with these functions IS_NUM(object) , IS_STR(object) , IS_LIST(object) , IS_FUN(object).
•	We get data from the users with INPUT() , INPUT_INT().
•	We must use PRINT(object) function to print something on the terminal.
